# 🚀 PASSENGER DATA CLEANING & VISUALIZATION

🔍 **PROJECT OVERVIEW**  
In this project, I performed end-to-end data cleaning and visualization on a passenger dataset. The workflow began with an initial analysis to understand the structure and distribution of the data.

📊 **DATA CLEANING & FEATURE ENGINEERING**  
- Handled missing values by filling the **'Age'** column with the **median** and the **'Embarked'** column with the **mode**, ensuring statistical integrity.  
- Removed irrelevant columns such as **'Name'**, **'SibSp'**, **'Parch'**, and **'Ticket'** to streamline the dataset.  
- Created a new feature called **'FamilySize'** by combining **'SibSp'** and **'Parch'**.  
- Extracted **'Title'** from the **'Name'** column to reduce high cardinality and enhance the model's understanding of social status.

📈 **VISUALIZATION**  
Used various plots to visualize trends and patterns in **survival rates**, **passenger class**, **gender**, and engineered features like **family size** and **title**.
